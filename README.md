# JAM-PY

Jam-py is a <b>proof of concept/educational experience</b> to learn the fundementals of interpreted programming languages. It is developed inside of Python, but the same approaches can be made in lower level programming languages. I am interested to see if I can implement a similar project in C++.

# Motivation

Jam-py is one of my ongoing projects to learn about interpreted programming languages. It has uses in many forms though, through the development of a lexer and parser, which have many use cases.

# Build Status

Working, not functional
